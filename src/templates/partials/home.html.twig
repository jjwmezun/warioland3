    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <div class="wl3-shot wl3-index-shot wl3-shot-cave"></div>
    <p>A true tour de force worthy o’ Hemingway. Wario’s riding his personal plane that rich people always have o’er an unnamed forest when the usual inconvenience happens: his engine spontaneously combusts, causing him to crash in said forest. The game shows off Wario’s invincibility by having him bounce ’way from the vanishing debris harmlessly.</p>
    <div class="wl3-shot wl3-index-shot wl3-shot-figure"></div>
    <p>There he returns to his feet &amp; looks both ways, presumably in search for a mechanic to help him rebuild his plane. He soon elects to search the cave to his right—where mechanics usually dwell.</p>
    <p>But ’stead he finds a music box there, just sitting on a pedastal—the most logical thing to happen in this story so far. Ne’er one to let treasure lie uncollected, he grabs it, only to be warped inside by some unnamed magic.</p>
    <p>Inside we find Wario fast asleep, only to be awoken e’en mo’ quickly to find some giant face peering in @ him. Said face, called in-game “A hidden figure,” ’splains the rest in a glorious poem worthy o’ Longfellow:</p>
    <blockquote class="verse">
        <p>Are you aware, Wario ?</p>
        <p>This world is in the music box</p>
        <p>you were peering into.</p>
        <p>I was the god that protected this world.</p>
        <p>But one day, a wicked being sealed away my</p>
        <p>power, and took control of this world.</p>
        <p>Wario,</p>
        <p>I want you to find the 5 music boxes needed to</p>
        <p>break the hidden seal and recover my powers.</p>
        <p>If you find them, I’ll send you back to</p>
        <p>your own world.</p>
        <p>Of course, all the treasure you find is</p>
        <p>yours to keep!</p>
        <p>Will you help me ?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Wario gives the hidden figure a thumbs up &amp; jogs on his way to the o’erworld map.</p>

<div class="wl3-primary-section wl3-primary-section-index wl3-index-goal" id="goal" style="padding-top: 106px; margin-top: -106px;">
    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p>Like most Wario Land games, the goal is to collect treasure.</p>
    <div class="wl3-primary-subsection wl3-primary-subsection-index wl3-index-goal-chestsnkeys">
        <h3>Chests &amp; Keys</h3>
        <p>In this case, the treasure are certain items found in the <span class="wl3-gray">gray</span>, <span class="wl3-red">red</span>, <span class="wl3-green">green</span>, &amp; <span class="wl3-blue">blue</span> chest found in every level,</p>
        <div class="wl3-index-chests">
            <div class="wl3-index-image wl3-image-chest wl3-image-gray-chest"></div>
            <div class="wl3-index-image wl3-image-chest wl3-image-red-chest"></div>
            <div class="wl3-index-image wl3-image-chest wl3-image-green-chest"></div>
            <div class="wl3-index-image wl3-image-chest wl3-image-blue-chest"></div>
        </div>
        <p>unlocked by keys o’ matching color.</p>
        <div class="wl3-index-keys">
            <div class="wl3-index-image wl3-image-key wl3-image-gray-key"></div>
            <div class="wl3-index-image wl3-image-key wl3-image-red-key"></div>
            <div class="wl3-index-image wl3-image-key wl3-image-green-key"></div>
            <div class="wl3-index-image wl3-image-key wl3-image-blue-key"></div>
        </div>
        <p>Touch a key to collect it,</p>
        <div class="wl3-index-image wl3-image-key-collect"></div>
        <p>Then touch a matching chest to collect its treasure (&amp; be kicked out o’ the level).</p>
        <div class="wl3-index-image wl3-image-chest-collect"></div>
        <p>’Pon returning to the level, already-opened chests will be replaced with chest doors, which will exit the level without getting a treasure, but will allow you to get a reward for <a href="#music-coins">collecting all 8 music coins</a> or will allow you to complete a Time Attack challenge.</p>
        <div class="wl3-index-image wl3-image-chest wl3-image-chest-door"></div>
        <p>But unlike in other games, wherein the treasures are collected on the way to the goal, in this game the treasures are the goals.</p>
        <p>As the story stated, the primary goal is to find the 5 music boxes ’mong all the treasures you collect &amp;, after that, return to “The Temple.”</p>
        <div class="wl3-index-music-boxes">
            <div class="wl3-index-image wl3-image-music-box wl3-image-music-box-1"></div>

            <div class="wl3-index-image wl3-image-music-box wl3-image-music-box-5"></div>
        </div>
        <p>However, one needs to collect all 100 treasures (4 treasures per 25 levels) to get 100%.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wl3-primary-subsection wl3-primary-subsection-index wl3-index-goal-coins" id="coins">
        <h3>Coins</h3>
        <p>Defeating enemies &amp; breaking blocks sometimes causes coins to fall out. You can collect up to 999 total.</p>
        <div class="wl3-index-image wl3-image-regular-coin"></div>
        <p>In addition to regular coins, which give 1 coin, there are rare <span class="wl3-gray">gray</span>, <span class="wl3-red">red</span>, <span class="wl3-green">green</span>, &amp; <span class="wl3-blue">blue</span> coins that give 10 coins.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Coins are only used to play minigames.</p>

    <div class="wl3-primary-subsection wl3-primary-subsection-index wl3-index-goal-music-coins" id="music-coins">
        <h3>Music Coins</h3>
        <p>The game also has 8 music coins in each level.</p>
        <div class="wl3-image-music-coin"></div>
        <p>Collect all 8 in a single playthrough o’ that level, &amp; you will fill in a piece o’ a painting corresponding to that level.</p>
